# League Latency 2 - dev0.1a

DISCLAIMER: LL2 is currently in early development and is very unstable. Use and/or download not recommended.

LL2 provides the same features as the original [League Latency](https://github.com/RyanChinSang/LeagueLatency/) and more!

LL2 uses its very own custom UI and graphics to display the real time plot and the various statistical data coming from every single ping request. 

LL2 uses PyQT4, pyqtgraph and custom-made (inspired) ping and administrator modules.

More information and features to come soon!
