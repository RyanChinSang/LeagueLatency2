Priority Info:
HIGH: If accomplished would add very meaningful functionality. These are usually challenging to accomplish.
MED : If accomplished would make the program more conformable, informative and user-friendly. Helps standardization.
LOW : If accomplished would add more meaning to either or both of documentation and presentation.

HIGH:
01- Enhance pypingn module to handle non-responses and errors (WIP) (RES)
    a. Packet loss; [sent, received, loss], timeout optimization
02- Link code to click-able objects in UI to handle functions: (BIG)
    a. For Menu Bar and all it's functionality (BIG) (MDN)
       i. Write functions
      ii. Test functions
    b. For Refresh button
       i. Write functions
      ii. Test functions
     NB1: The intent is to clear the graph while keeping the most recent statistics and continue plotting
    c. For Add a server button
       i. Write function (WIP)
          A. Pop-up working, but when closing the QDialog, the program exits in error
          B. Able to catch the input data on Accept() (the OK button)
          C. (ALT) CHANGE OVER TO LL3.ui (UND)
             I. Write function to show the table data in "servs.xlsx"
            II. Tie functionality to 02.d.ii.
      ii. Test function (WIP)
    d. Drop-down menu for Server list
       i. Link to the spreadsheet "servs.xlsx" to show all the records' "Name" (WIP)
      ii. Write functions for:
          A. Find Address given a Name (done)
          B. Add record given a Name and Address (done)(UND)
          C. Delete record given a Name and/or Address (UND)
          D. (ALT) have a Table Widget (QObject) handle all the editing (UND)
     iii. (ALT) Use ".csv" format instead? (UND)
03- Link code to actively change the icons on buttons to mimic what is done in LL1
    i. Curr. Ping
   ii. Avg. Ping
  iii. Play/Pause for Resume/Pause button (WIP)
       A. The text changes on clicking (done)
       B. The graph pauses and resumes on clicking (done)
       C. Insert/Create icon and have that change accordingly (WIP)
04- Live Plotting slows down considerably at 15-20 seconds
    i. This may be due to the dynamically increasing numpy arrays
   ii. Solution is to use a buffer, but the buffer data layout is unsupported by the PlotWidget (RES) (DDL: v1.0a)
05- Fix nasty handling of events? (RES) When opening Dialog from MainWindow and then closing (REF: #02.c.i.A.)
    (DDL: dev0.5a)
    NB1: "QObject::startTimer: QTimer can only be used with threads started with QThread"


MED:
01- Sort local dependencies into correct/standard folders (WIP)
    i. (DDL: dev0.3a) release this in a Stable folder (and with dependencies in correctly named sub-folders)
02- Clean up code (BIG) (MDN)
03- Add keyboard shortcuts to functionality (MDN)
    a. Best use QTDesigner for this.
04- Revise and finalize Icons in the UI (DDL: v1.0a)


LOW:
01- Better formatting the support documents
    a. Alphabetical ordering etc. (MDN)
02- Use a better platform for documenting (RES) (DDL: v1.0a)
